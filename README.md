SmartyML
========

This class extends the Smarty Template Engine with multilanguage support. I "stole" the idea from André Rabold who published his code on this page:
http://smarty.incutio.com/?page=SmartyMultiLanguageSupport

I updated the code for Smarty 2 and PHP 5.
I am working on a version for Smarty 3. It´s not done yet.
